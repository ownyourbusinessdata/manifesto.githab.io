# Own your business data
# Manifesto

**The data generated by a business should be owned by this business for its own and its customers benefits.**

## Principles
1. Own data warehouse over vendor locked in
2. Central warehouse rather over silos 
3. Open, transferable data format over vendor proprietary
4. De-coupled warehouse, ETL and business analysis tool over monolith
5. Open-source over proprietary 



## Notes
1. Own warehouse doesnâ€™t necessary mean owned physical infrastructure, use of AWS, Azure or other cloud infrastructure is fine as long as you have a plan of how can you move out if required
